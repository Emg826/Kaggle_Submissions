# Machine Learning - Kaggle Submissions
Kaggle.com is a website that hosts machine learning data sets and many machine learning competitions. This repository is a collection of python notebooks detailing my submissions to various contests on the website. By "detailing" I mean that I try to walkthrough the entire process of model building: data cleaning, feature engineering, imputing missing values, and, of course, making predictions.

+ titanic_survivor_predictions.ipynb: try to predict who did and did not survive the Titanic. This required feature engineering, missing value imputation, and testing various algorithms for generalizablity. Achieved 79.4% accuracy, which, as of Jun. 18, 2018, puts the model at 2,532nd place out of 11,356 people.
